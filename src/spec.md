# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove unnecessary public-facing and documentation references to caffeine.xyz/caffeine.ai/caffine.xyz, replacing them with neutral text where needed.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the website footer to remove any caffeine attribution/links (including UTM parameters) and replace with an English copyright line for the shop (using the current year).
- Search and remove/replace any other user-facing UI text referencing caffeine.ai/caffeine.xyz/caffine.xyz.
- Update repository documentation and configuration examples to remove caffeine.xyz/caffine.xyz references, using a neutral placeholder domain (e.g., example.com) where examples are needed.

**User-visible outcome:** The site footer and any other visible text no longer reference caffeine domains, and docs/examples no longer include caffeine.xyz/caffine.xyz URLs.
