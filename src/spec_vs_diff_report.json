REQ-23 is not evidenced as implemented because no documentation/config-example files are shown as modified where caffeine.xyz/caffine.xyz references would be removed/replaced.",

      "requirement": "Remove or replace any references to the domain \"caffeine.xyz\" or \"caffine.xyz\" in repository documentation and configuration examples (use neutral placeholder like example.com).",
      "reason": "The diff shows only 3 modified files (App.tsx, frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json) and does not show any edits to documentation/config example files where such domain references would be removed/replaced. Therefore there is no concrete evidence REQ-23 was implemented.",
